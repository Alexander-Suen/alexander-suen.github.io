As part of my commitment to community involvement and social responsibility, I lead a poverty survey conducted across various regions in Zhejiang Province, China. This endeavor aimed to assess and understand the socioeconomic challenges faced by marginalized communities within the province. Through this initiative, I sought to contribute to the identification of key areas requiring intervention and facilitate the development of targeted solutions to alleviate poverty and promote sustainable development. This engagement not only allowed me to gain practical experience in conducting field surveys but also fostered a deep appreciation for the complexities of poverty and the importance of community-driven efforts in addressing social inequities.
