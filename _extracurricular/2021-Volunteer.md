During my tenure as a veterinary assistant at Zhejiang University Affiliated Animal Hospital, I gained extensive hands-on experience and played a vital role in supporting the healthcare team in providing comprehensive veterinary care to a diverse range of animal patients. My responsibilities encompassed various facets of veterinary assistance, including animal reception, disease counseling, patient care, drug preparation, ultrasonography assistance, doctor support, and clinical laboratory testing.

However, this experience served as a catalyst in inspiring me to explore the intersection of veterinary medicine and cutting-edge technologies, particularly in the fields of medical AI, drug discovery, and AI-aided diagnosis. During my time as a veterinary assistant, I witnessed the challenges faced by veterinary professionals in diagnosing complex diseases and designing effective treatment strategies. I became acutely aware of the immense volume of data generated through patient records, diagnostic tests, and medical imaging, and the need for innovative approaches to leverage this wealth of information.

This exposure motivated me to delve deeper into the potential of medical AI. I recognized that by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we can extract meaningful insights from vast datasets, accelerate drug discovery processes, and enhance diagnostic accuracy. This realization ignited my passion for exploring how AI can revolutionize veterinary and human healthcare.

The experience of working alongside veterinarians and witnessing their expertise and dedication reinforced the importance of developing AI tools to aid in medical decision-making. The complexity and variability of disease presentations highlighted the need for sophisticated algorithms capable of analyzing diverse data points, recognizing patterns, and providing actionable insights that can assist veterinarians in making accurate diagnoses and recommending optimal treatment plans.

Moreover, my exposure to drug preparation and disease counseling underscored the significance of advancements in AI-enabled drug discovery. I recognized the potential for AI algorithms to analyze molecular structures, predict drug efficacy, and identify novel therapeutic targets. These capabilities have the potential to significantly expedite the discovery and development of new treatments, benefiting both veterinary and human patients alike.
