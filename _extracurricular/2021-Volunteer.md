As a Certified Outstanding Volunteer (5-star volunteer in Chinese) at Zhejiang University, I have dedicated over 300 hours to various volunteering initiatives, demonstrating my commitment to serving the community and making a positive impact. Here are some selected experiences:

Local Hospital Volunteering:
I actively participated in volunteer programs at a local hospital, where I assisted healthcare professionals in providing care and support to patients. I facilitated patient comfort by offering companionship, providing assistance with daily activities, and engaging in recreational activities to uplift their spirits. This experience deepened my understanding of the healthcare system and the importance of compassion in patient care.

Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition Volunteering:
I enthusiastically contributed to an innovation and entrepreneurship competition (Internet Plus) organized at Zhejiang Province. As a volunteer, I played a crucial role in event coordination, ensuring smooth logistics, participant registration, and venue setup. This experience allowed me to witness the transformative power of Internet and innovation in driving societal progress.

Throughout my volunteering experiences, I have developed essential skills such as effective communication, teamwork, and adaptability. These experiences have broadened my perspective, enhanced my cultural competence, and nurtured a deep sense of empathy and social responsibility.
