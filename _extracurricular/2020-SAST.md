As an active member and later as Vice President of the Student Association of Science & Technology (SAST) at Zhejiang University, I played a significant role in fostering a vibrant academic community and promoting scientific exploration among fellow students.

Key contributions include:
- SAST's club tier ranking increased from 4-star to 5-star (highest possible association ranking) during my tenure.
- Coordinated student club activities such as the Lazy Manâ€™s Innovation Competition.
- Organizing and coordinating the SAST's annual anniversary celebration, a flagship event that celebrated the achievements of the association and showcased student-led research and projects to a wide audience (include the university headmaster).
- Developing partnerships and collaborations with other academic clubs and organizations, fostering interdisciplinary connections and promoting knowledge exchange.
