I possess fundamental design skills in Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, enabling me to create visually compelling and aesthetically pleasing designs. These tools have equipped me with the ability to manipulate images, create graphics, and enhance visual elements to effectively communicate ideas and concepts, which benefited me a lot in later student club activities.
