In the [Hangzhou CDC](http://wsjkw.hangzhou.gov.cn/art/2020/9/14/art_1229232829_75549.html) internship, we learned state-of-art techniques, especially genomics and bioinformatics in the diagnosis and tracing of infectious diseases. We practiced genomic surveillance of a recent salmonella exploration in Hangzhou, China. This process involves sequencing the pathogen's genetic material, preprocessing the data, assembling the genome, identifying variants and mutations, conducting phylogenetic analysis, and facilitating global data sharing. By integrating genomic data with metadata such as patient information, travel history, and disease outcomes, we finished the tracing of transmission chains and the identification of potential sources of Salmonella infection.
