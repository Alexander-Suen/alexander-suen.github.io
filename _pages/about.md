I am currently an undergraduate student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) (ZJU), specializing in Veterinary Medicine & Statistics with a minor in Computer Science. I am poised to obtain my B.S. degree in 2024. My academic trajectory was shaped by an intrinsic curiosity about artificial intelligence as well as data science and an aspiration to leave a tangible mark on our world. After completing my medical research & coursework in 2022, I pursued advanced studies in statistics and computer science at ZJU, with a specific focus on conducting research in the domain of artificial intelligence and related fields.

My academic interests encompass a wide range of disciplines, spanning from data science to the intricacies of deep learning. In particular, I harbor a deep curiosity for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Data Science, AI-based medical research, and their potential applications across diverse scientific and engineering domains. What's more, I had some research experience in genetic evolution and wanted to see if I could simulate similar mechanism in novel AI models. By achieving this, I believe AI can better comprehend human directives, leading to a more streamlined human-machine synergy.

Currently, I am proactively exploring opportunities to serve as a Research Assistant (RA) in fields that align with my areas of interest. My goal is to commit one year to immerse myself in research activities before embarking on a doctoral program.
