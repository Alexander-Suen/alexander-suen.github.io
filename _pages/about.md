I am currently a PhD student at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Veterinary Medicine and Statistics, with a minor in Computer Science, from Zhejiang University, China. My academic path was shaped by an intrinsic curiosity about modern computational methods for medicine as well as Artificial Intelligence and an aspiration to leave a tangible mark on our world. My research interests lie at the intersection of computational biology, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve real-world problems in biology and medicine. I am passionate about transforming cutting-edge AI technologies into practical applications that advance biological data processing and medical insights. Currently, I am exploring innovative ways to leverage LLMs for tasks such as genome pattern recognition, biomedical data analysis, and predictive modeling in healthcare.
