I am currently an undergraduate student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), specializing in Veterinary Medicine & Statistics with a minor in Computer Science. I am poised to obtain my B.S. degree in 2024. My academic trajectory was shaped by an intrinsic curiosity about intelligence and an aspiration to leave a tangible mark on our world. Upon concluding my medical coursework in 2022, I studied statistics and computer science at Zhejiang University for further intelligence related research.

My scholarly pursuits span a diverse array of domains, from data science to intricate mechanisms of deep learning. Specifically, I am curious about the realms of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), patterns of intelligent behavior, biologically inspired AI, and their ensuing applications across scientific and engineering disciplines. The advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the attention mechanism have profoundly influenced my academic perspective, kindling my aspiration to unearth novel mechanisms that might endue AI with enhanced generalization capabilities similar to biological entities. I have a big (maybe impractical) AI dream to engineer biological intelligence from scratch and emulate such intelligence in artificial constructs. By achieving this, I believe AI can better comprehend human directives, leading to a more streamlined human-machine synergy.

At present, I am actively seeking research assistant (RA) positions in areas aligned with my interests. My intention is to dedicate 1 year to engaging in research endeavors before pursuing a doctoral degree. This path will enable me to deepen my understanding of these subjects and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of biologically inspired AI.
