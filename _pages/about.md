I am an undergraduate student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), majoring in Veterinary Medicine and Statistics with a minor in Computer Science. I am about to graduate with a B.S. degree in 2024. Following the completion of my medical coursework in 2022, I made the decision to further pursue studies in statistics and computer science at Zhejiang University, driven by my curosity of intelligence and the ambition to make a meaningful impact on the world.

My academic interests encompass a wide range of subjects, including statistical machine learning, data science, drug discovery, causal inference, intelligence behavior, biological intelligence-inspired AI, and their applications in the fields of science and engineering. I also have a big (maybe impractical) dream that I could create biological intelligence from scratch and replicate intelligence in machines.

At present, I am actively seeking research assistant (RA) positions in areas aligned with my interests. My intention is to dedicate 1-2 years to engaging in research endeavors before pursuing a doctoral degree. This path will enable me to deepen my understanding of these subjects and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in my chosen field.
