I am currently an undergraduate student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), specializing in Veterinary Medicine & Statistics with a minor in Computer Science. I am poised to obtain my B.S. degree in 2024. My academic trajectory was shaped by an intrinsic curiosity about artificial intelligence and an aspiration to leave a tangible mark on our world. After completing my medical research & coursework in 2022, I pursued advanced studies in statistics and computer science at Zhejiang University, with a specific focus on conducting research in the domain of artificial intelligence and related fields.

My academic interests encompass a wide range of disciplines, spanning from data science to the intricacies of deep learning. In particular, I harbor a deep curiosity for various facets of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), patterns underlying intelligent behavior, biologically inspired AI, and their potential applications across diverse scientific and engineering domains. The advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the attention mechanism have profoundly influenced my academic perspective, kindling my aspiration to unearth novel mechanisms that might endue AI with enhanced generalization capabilities akin to biological entities. What's more, I had some research experience in genetic evolution and wanted to see if I could simulate similar mechanism in novel AI models. I have a big (maybe impractical) AI dream to engineer biological intelligence from scratch and emulate such intelligence in artificial constructs. By achieving this, I believe AI can better comprehend human directives, leading to a more streamlined human-machine synergy.

Currently, I am proactively exploring opportunities to serve as a Research Assistant (RA) in fields that align with my areas of interest. My goal is to commit one year to immerse myself in research activities before embarking on a doctoral program. I am convinced that some research experience in the field of cognitively inspired AI will afford me the opportunity to further delve into that domain.
