Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) caused by coronary artery disease always leads to myocardial infarction and heart failure. In this study, we used two RNA-seq datasets and one microarray dataset from different studies, including 25 ICM and 21 non-failing control (NF) samples of human left ventricle tissues for further analysis. GO and KEGG analyses of DEGs indicated that the response to wounding, positive regulation of smooth muscle contraction, chromatin, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and transporters pathways are involved in ICM. Simple Enrichment Analysis found that NFIC-binding motifs are enriched in promoter regions of downregulated genes. The Gene Importance Calculator further proved that NFIC is vital. NFIC and its downstream genes were verified in the validating microarray dataset.
