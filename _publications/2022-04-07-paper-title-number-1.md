In this study, we explored the molecular characteristics of the LEG1 protein in a pig model (pLEG1a). We detected the pLEG1a protein in both the salivary gland and lung. Moreover, pLEG1a could be detected in the saliva, suggesting its secretory nature. Ectopic expression of pLEG1a in HEK293T cells further confirmed that pLEG1a was a secretory protein. In addition, glycosylation tests showed the existence of glycosylated bands which could be enzymatically removed, indicating that the secreted pLEG1a was N-glycosylated.
