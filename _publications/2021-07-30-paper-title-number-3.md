In this paper, we studied the genetic sequences of <i>ADTRP/AIG1</i> gene family to determine their evolutionary history and relatedness. By comparing the DNAs sequences, constructing phylogenetic trees, and performing selection force analysis, we identified common ancestry and potential functional implications of the <i>ADTRP/AIG1</i> family.
